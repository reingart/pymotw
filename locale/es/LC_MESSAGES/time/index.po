"The :mod:`time` module exposes C library functions for manipulating dates "
"and times.  Since it is tied to the underlying C implementation, some "
"details (such as the start of the epoch and maximum date value supported) "
"are platform-specific.  Refer to the library documentation for complete "
"details."

"One of the core functions of the :mod:`time` module is :func:`time()`, which"

"point value."

"The float representation is useful when storing or comparing dates, but not "
"as useful for producing human readable representations. For logging or "
"printing time :func:`ctime()` can be more useful."

msgstr ""

#: ../../PyMOTW/time/index.rst:56
msgid ""
"While :func:`time()` returns a wall clock time, :func:`clock()` returns "
"processor clock time.  The values returned from :func:`clock()` should be "
"used for performance testing, benchmarking, etc. since they reflect the "
"actual time used by the program, and can be more precise than the values "
"from :func:`time()`."

msgid ""
"In this example, the formatted :func:`ctime()` is printed along with the "
"floating point values from :func:`time()`, and :func:`clock()` for each "
"iteration through the loop. If you want to run the example on your system, "
"you may have to add more cycles to the inner loop or work with a larger "
"amount of data to actually see a difference."

"In this example, the loop does very little work by going to sleep after each"

msgid ""
"Storing times as elapsed seconds is useful in some situations, but there are"
" times when you need to have access to the individual fields of a date "
"(year, month, etc.). The :mod:`time` module defines :class:`struct_time` for"
" holding date and time values with components broken out so they are easy to"
" access. There are several functions that work with :class:`struct_time` "
"values instead of floats."

":func:`gmtime()` returns the current time in UTC. :func:`localtime()` "
"returns the current time with the current time zone applied. "
":func:`mktime()` takes a :class:`struct_time` and converts it to the "
"floating point representation."

"The functions for determining the current time depend on having the time "
"zone set, either by your program or by using a default time zone set for the"

"way it is represented."
msgstr ""

#: ../../PyMOTW/time/index.rst:176
msgid ""
"To change the time zone, set the environment variable ``TZ``, then call "
":func:`tzset()`.  Using TZ, you can specify the time zone with a lot of "
"detail, right down to the start and stop times for daylight savings time. It"
