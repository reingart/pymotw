"Programming with Unix signal handlers is a non-trivial endeavor. This is an "
"introduction, and does not include all of the details you may need to use "
"signals successfully on every platform. There is some degree of "
"standardization across versions of Unix, but there is also some variation, "
"so consult documentation for your OS if you run into trouble."

"Signals are an operating system feature that provide a means of notifying "
"your program of an event, and having it handled asynchronously.  They can be"
" generated by the system itself, or sent from one process to another.  Since"
" signals interrupt the regular flow of your program, it is possible that "
"some operations (especially I/O) may produce error if a signal is received "
"in the middle."

"Signals are identified by integers and are defined in the operating system C"
" headers.  Python exposes the signals appropriate for the platform as "
"symbols in the :mod:`signal` module.  For the examples below, I will use "
"``SIGINT`` and ``SIGUSR1``.  Both are typically defined for all Unix and "
"Unix-like systems."

#: ../../PyMOTW/signal/index.rst:34
msgid ""
"As with other forms of event-based programming, signals are received by "
"establishing a callback function, called a *signal handler*, that is invoked"
" when the signal occurs.  The arguments to your signal handler are the "
"signal number and the stack frame from the point in your program that was "
"interrupted by the signal."

"This relatively simple example script loops indefinitely, pausing for a few "
"seconds each time.  When a signal comes in, the sleep call is interrupted "
"and the signal handler ``receive_signal()`` prints the signal number.  When "
"the signal handler returns, the loop continues."

"To send signals to the running program, I use the command line program kill."
"  To produce the output below, I ran ``signal_signal.py`` in one window, "
"then ``kill -USR1 $pid``, ``kill -USR2 $pid``, and ``kill -INT $pid`` in "
"another."

"To see what signal handlers are registered for a signal, use "
":func:`getsignal()`.  Pass the signal number as argument.  The return value "
"is the registered handler, or one of the special values ``signal.SIG_IGN`` "
"(if the signal is being ignored), ``signal.SIG_DFL`` (if the default "
"behavior is being used), or ``None`` (if the existing signal handler was "
"registered from C, rather than Python)."

"Alarms are a special sort of signal, where your program asks the OS to "

" this is useful for avoiding blocking indefinitely on an I/O operation or "
"other system call."

msgid ""
"To ignore a signal, register ``SIG_IGN`` as the handler.  This script "
"replaces the default handler for ``SIGINT`` with ``SIG_IGN``, and registers "
"a handler for ``SIGUSR1``.  Then it uses :func:`signal.pause()` to wait for "
"a signal to be received."

msgid ""
"Normally ``SIGINT`` (the signal sent by the shell to your program when you "
"hit Ctrl-C) raises a :ref:`KeyboardInterrupt <exceptions-"
"KeyboardInterrupt>`.  In this example, we ignore ``SIGINT`` and raise "
":ref:`SystemExit <exceptions-SystemExit>` when we see ``SIGUSR1``.  Each "
"``^C`` represents an attempt to use Ctrl-C to kill the script from the "
"terminal.  Using ``kill -USR1 72598`` from another terminal eventually "
"causes the script to exit."

"Signals and threads don't generally mix well because only the main thread of"

msgid ""
"Notice that the signal handlers were all registered in the main thread.  "
"This is a requirement of the signal module implementation for Python, "
"regardless of underlying platform support for mixing threads and signals.  "
"Although the receiver thread calls :func:`signal.pause()`, it does not "
"receive the signal.  The ``signal.alarm(2)`` call near the end of the "
"example prevents an infinite block, since the receiver thread will never "
"exit."
