"It usually more useful to be able to spawn a process with arguments to tell "
"it what work to do.  Unlike with :mod:`threading`, to pass arguments to a "
":mod:`multiprocessing` :class:`Process` the argument must be able to be "

"One difference between the :mod:`threading` and :mod:`multiprocessing` "
"examples is the extra protection for ``__main__`` used in the "
":mod:`multiprocessing` examples.  Due to the way the new processes are "
"started, the child process needs to be able to import the script containing "
"the target function.  Wrapping the main part of the application in a check "
"for ``__main__`` ensures that it is not run recursively in each child as the"
" module is imported.  Another approach is to import the target function from"
" a separate script."

"Passing arguments to identify or name the process is cumbersome, and "
