":class:`StringIO` provides a convenient means of working with text in memory"
" using the file API (read, write. etc.). There are two separate "
"implementations. The :mod:`cStringIO` version is written in C for speed, "
"while :mod:`StringIO` is written in Python for portability. Using "
":mod:`cStringIO` to build large strings can offer performance savings over "
"some other string conctatenation techniques."

"This example uses :func:`read()`, but the :func:`readline()` and "
":func:`readlines()` methods are also available. The :class:`StringIO` class "
"also provides a :func:`seek()` method so it is possible to jump around in a "
"buffer while reading, which can be useful for rewinding if you are using "
"some sort of look-ahead parsing algorithm."

"The application we are building at work includes a shell scripting interface"
" in the form of several command line programs. Some of these programs are "
"responsible for pulling data from the database and dumping it on the console"
" (either to show the user, or so the text can serve as input to another "
"command). The commands share a set of formatter plugins to produce a text "
"representation of an object in a variety of ways (XML, bash syntax, human "
"readable, etc.). Since the formatters normally write to standard output, "
"testing the results would be a little tricky without the StringIO module. "
"Using StringIO to intercept the output of the formatter gives us an easy way"
" to collect the output in memory to compare against expected results."
