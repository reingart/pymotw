"The :mod:`cmd` module contains one public class, :class:`Cmd`, designed to "

"The interpreter uses a loop to read all lines from its input, parse them, "

"are parsed into two parts. The command, and any other text on the line. If "
"the user enters a command ``foo bar``, and your class includes a method "

"The output shows one optional argument to the greet command, *person*. "
"Although the argument is optional to the command, there is a distinction "
"between the command and the callback method. The method always takes the "
"argument, but sometimes the value is an empty string. It is left up to the "
"command processor to determine if an empty argument is valid, or do any "
"further parsing and processing of the command. In this example, if a "
"person's name is provided then the greeting is personalized."

"In the previous example, the formatting of the help text leaves something to "
"be desired. Since it comes from the docstring, it retains the indentation "
"from our source. We could edit the source to remove the extra white-space, "
"but that would leave our application looking poorly formatted. An "
"alternative solution is to implement a help handler for the greet command, "
"named :func:`help_greet()`. When present, the help handler is called on to "
"produce help text for the named command."

":class:`Cmd` includes support for command completion based on the names of "

msgstr ""

#: ../../PyMOTW/cmd/index.rst:188
msgid ""
"Once the command is known, argument completion is handled by methods with "
"the prefix ``complete_``. This allows you to assemble a list of possible "
"completions using your own criteria (query a database, look at at a file or "
"directory on the filesystem, etc.). In this case, the program has a hard-"
"coded set of \"friends\" who receive a less formal greeting than named or "
"anonymous strangers. A real program would probably save the list somewhere, "

":func:`cmdloop()` is the main processing loop of the interpreter. You can "

"Each iteration through :func:`cmdloop()` calls :func:`onecmd()` to dispatch "

"If the line is empty, :func:`emptyline()` is called. The default "

msgid ""
"If you would rather have your program read the script file directly, a few "
