"Up to this point, the example programs have implicitly waited to exit until "

"\"heart beats\" for a service monitoring tool). To mark a thread as a "

"Although the point of using multiple threads is to spin separate operations "

":func:`set()` or :func:`clear()`. Other threads can :func:`wait()` for the "

msgid ""
"In addition to synchronizing the operations of threads, it is also important"
" to be able to control access to shared resources to prevent corruption or "
"missed data. Python's built-in data structures (lists, dictionaries, etc.) "
"are thread-safe as a side-effect of having atomic byte-codes for "
"manipulating them (the GIL is not released in the middle of an update). "
"Other data structures implemented in Python, or simpler types like integers "
"and floats, don't have that protection. To guard against simultaneous access"
" to an object, use a :class:`Lock` object."
msgstr ""

#: ../../PyMOTW/threading/index.rst:410
msgid ""
"In this example, the :func:`worker()` function increments a :class:`Counter`"
" instance, which manages a :class:`Lock` to prevent two threads from "

#: ../../PyMOTW/threading/index.rst:443
msgid ""
"To find out whether another thread has acquired the lock without holding up "
"the current thread, pass False for the *blocking* argument to "
":func:`acquire()`. In the next example, :func:`worker()` tries to acquire "
"the lock three separate times, and counts how many attempts it has to make "
"to do so. In the mean time, :func:`lock_holder` cycles between holding and "
"releasing the lock, with short pauses in each state used to simulate load."

msgstr ""

#: ../../PyMOTW/threading/index.rst:569
msgid ""
"In addition to using :class:`Events`, another way of synchronizing threads "
"is through using a :class:`Condition` object. Because the :class:`Condition`"
" uses a :class:`Lock`, it can be tied to a shared resource. This allows "
"threads to wait for the resource to be updated. In this example, the "
":func:`consumer()` threads :func:`wait()` for the :class:`Condition` to be "

"setting the condition and notifying the other threads that they can "
"continue."

"Sometimes it is useful to allow more than one worker access to a resource at"

"In this example, the :class:`ActivePool` class simply serves as a convenient"
