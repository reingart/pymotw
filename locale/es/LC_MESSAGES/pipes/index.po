"The :mod:`pipes` module implements a class to create arbitrarily complex "

msgstr ""

#: ../../PyMOTW/pipes/index.rst:28
msgid ""
"The pipeline Template is created and then a single command, ``cat -`` is "
"added.  The command reads standard input and writes it to standard output, "
"without modification.  The second argument to ``append()`` encodes the input"
" and output sources for the command in two characters (input, then output)."
"  Using ``-`` means the command uses standard I/O.  Using ``f`` means the "
"command needs to read from a file (as may be the case with an image "
"processing pipeline)."

"Reading from a pipeline works basically the same way, with a few changes to "

msgid ""
"Some commands need to work on files on the filesystem instead of input "
"streams.  Commands that process a large amount of data might perform better "
"in this mode, since they will not block on the next command reading their "
"output.  Anything that works on non-stream-based data requires this "
"capability as well (e.g., databases or other binary file manipulation "
"tools).  To support this mode of operation, ``append()`` lets you specify a "
"*kind* of ``f``, and the pipeline code will create the needed temporary "
"files.  The filenames are passed to the shell as ``$IN`` and ``$OUT``, so "
"those variable names need to appear in your command string."

"before bringing it into Python."

"My `virtualenvwrapper "
