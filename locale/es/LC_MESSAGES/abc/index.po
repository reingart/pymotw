"Abstract base classes are a form of interface checking more strict than "
"individual ``hasattr()`` checks for particular methods.  By defining an "
"abstract base class, you can define a common API for a set of subclasses.  "
"This capability is especially useful in situations where a third-party is "
"going to provide implementations, such as with plugins to an application, "
"but can also aid you when working on a large team or with a large code-base "
"where keeping all classes in your head at the same time is difficult or not "
"possible."

":mod:`abc` works by marking methods of the base class as abstract, and then "
"registering concrete classes as implementations of the abstract base.  If "
"your code requires a particular API, you can use ``issubclass()`` or "
"``isinstance()`` to check an object against the abstract class."

"A side-effect of using direct subclassing is it is possible to find all of "

"Although a concrete class must provide an implementation of an abstract "
