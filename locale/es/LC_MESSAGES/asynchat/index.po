"The :mod:`asynchat` module builds on :mod:`asyncore` to make it easier to "
"implement protocols based on passing messages back and forth between server "
"and client. The :class:`async_chat` class is an :class:`asyncore.dispatcher`"
" subclass that receives data and looks for a message terminator. Your "
"subclass only needs to specify what to do when data comes in and how to "
"respond once the terminator is found. Outgoing data is queued for "
"transmission via FIFO objects managed by :class:`async_chat`."

"The :class:`EchoServer` example below uses both a simple string terminator "

"To make it easier to understand how :mod:`asynchat` is different from "
":mod:`asyncore`, the examples here duplicate the functionality of the "
