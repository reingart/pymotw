"The asyncore module includes tools for working with I/O objects such as "
"sockets so they can be managed asynchronously (instead of, for example, "
"using threads).  The main class provided is :class:`dispatcher`, a wrapper "
"around a socket that provides hooks for handling events like connecting, "
"reading, and writing when invoked from the main loop function, :func:`loop`."

"To create an asyncore-based client, subclass :class:`dispatcher` and provide"

"First, the socket is created in ``__init__()`` using the base class method "
"``create_socket()``.  Alternative implementations of the method may be "
"provided, but in this case we want a TCP/IP socket so the base class version"
" is sufficient."

"The ``handle_connect()`` hook is present simply to illustrate when it is "

" protocol negotiation should do the work in ``handle_connect()``."

"``handle_close()`` is similarly presented for the purposes of showing when "
"the method is called.  The base class version closes the socket correctly, "

"The asyncore loop uses ``writable()`` and its sibling method ``readable()`` "
"to decide what actions to take with each dispatcher.  Actual use of poll() "
"or select() on the sockets or file descriptors managed by each dispatcher is"
" handled inside the :mod:`asyncore` code, so you don't need to do that "
"yourself.  Simply indicate whether the dispatcher cares at all about reading"
" or writing.  In the case of this HTTP client, ``writable()`` returns True "
"as long as there is data from the request to send to the server.  "
"``readable()`` always returns True because we want to read all of the data."

"Each time through the loop when ``writable()`` responds positively, "
"``handle_write()`` is invoked.  In this version, the HTTP request string "

"The example below the ``__main__`` test configures logging for debugging "
"then creates two clients to download two separate web pages.  Creating the "
"clients registers them in a \"map\" kept internally by asyncore.  The "
"downloading occurs as the loop iterates over the clients.  When the client "
"reads 0 bytes from a socket that seems readable, the condition is "
"interpreted as a closed connection and ``handle_close()`` is called."

"The example below illustrates using asyncore on the server by re-"
"implementing the EchoServer from the :mod:`SocketServer` examples.  There "
"are three classes: ``EchoServer`` receives incoming connections from clients"
" and creates ``EchoHandler`` instances to deal with each.  The "
"``EchoClient`` is an asyncore dispatcher similar to the HttpClient defined "
"above."
msgstr ""

#: ../../PyMOTW/asyncore/index.rst:91
msgid ""
"The EchoServer and EchoHandler are defined in separate classes because they "
"do different things.  When EchoServer accepts a connection, a new socket is "
"established.  Rather than try to dispatch to individual clients within "
"EchoServer, an EchoHandler is created to take advantage of the socket map "
"maintained by asyncore."

"In this example the server, handler, and client objects are all being "
"maintained in the same socket map by asyncore in a single process. To "
"separate the server from the client, simply instantiate them from separate "
"scripts and run ``asyncore.loop()`` in both. When a dispatcher is closed, it"
" is removed from the map maintained by asyncore and the loop exits when the "
"map is empty."

"It is sometimes necessary to integrate the asyncore event loop with an event"
" loop from the parent application.  For example, a GUI application would not"
" want the UI to block until all asynchronous transfers are handled -- that "
"would defeat the purpose of making them asynchronous.  To make this sort of "
"integration easy, ``asyncore.loop()`` accepts arguments to set a timeout and"
" to limit the number of times the loop is run.  We can see their effect on "
"the client by re-using HttpClient from the first example."

"Here we see that the client is only asked to read or data once per call into"

"mechanism for doing a small amount of work when the UI is not busy with "
