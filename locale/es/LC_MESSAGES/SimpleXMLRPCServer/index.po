"This simple server example exposes a single function that takes the name of "
"a directory and returns the contents. The first step is to create the "
":class:`SimpleXMLRPCServer` instance and tell it where to listen for "
"incoming requests ('localhost' port 9000 in this case). Then we define a "
"function to be part of the service, and register the function so the server "
"knows how to call it. The final step is to put the server into an infinite "
"loop receiving and responding to requests."

"Individual functions can be registered with names that are not normally "

"functions are registered using the prefix \"``dir.``\" so that the same "
"server can provide other services using a different prefix. One other "
