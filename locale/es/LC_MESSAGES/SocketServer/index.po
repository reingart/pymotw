"The :mod:`SocketServer` module is a framework for creating network servers. "
"It defines classes for handling synchronous network requests (the server "
"request handler blocks until the request is completed) over TCP, UDP, Unix "
"streams, and Unix datagrams. It also provides mix-in classes for easily "
"converting servers to use a separate thread or process for each request, "
"depending on what is most appropriate for your situation."

#: ../../PyMOTW/SocketServer/index.rst:19
msgid ""
"Responsibility for processing a request is split between a server class and "
"a request handler class. The server deals with the communication issues "
"(listing on a socket, accepting connections, etc.) and the request handler "
"deals with the \"protocol\" issues (interpreting incoming data, processing "
"it, sending data back to the client). This division of responsibility means "
"that in many cases you can simply use one of the existing server classes "
"without any modifications, and provide a request handler class for it to "
"work with your protocol."

"There are five different server classes defined in :mod:`SocketServer`.  "
":class:`BaseServer` defines the API, and is not really intended to be "
"instantiated and used directly. :class:`TCPServer` uses TCP/IP sockets to "
"communicate. :class:`UDPServer` uses datagram sockets. "
":class:`UnixStreamServer` and :class:`UnixDatagramServer` use Unix-domain "
"sockets and are only available on Unix platforms."

"To construct a server, pass it an address on which to listen for requests "

"Once the server object is instantiated, use either :func:`handle_request()` "
"or :func:`serve_forever()` to process requests. The :func:`serve_forever()` "
"method simply calls :func:`handle_request()` in an infinite loop, so if you "
"need to integrate the server with another event loop or use :func:`select()`"
" to monitor several sockets for different servers, you could call "
":func:`handle_request()` on your own. See the example below for more detail."
