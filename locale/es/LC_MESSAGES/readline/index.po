msgid ""
"There are two ways to configure the underlying readline library, using a "
"configuration file or the ``parse_and_bind()`` function. Configuration "
"options include the keybinding to invoke completion, editing modes (vi or "
"emacs), and many other values.  Refer to the `GNU readline library "
"documentation "
"<http://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/readline.html#SEC10>`_ for "
"details."

msgid ""
"The easiest way to enable tab-completion is through a call to "
"``parse_and_bind()``.  Other options can be set at the same time. This "
"example changes the editing controls to use \"vi\" mode instead of the "
"default of \"emacs\".  To edit the current input line, press ``ESC`` then "
"use normal vi navigation keys such as ``j``, ``k``, ``l``, and ``h``."

"The ``input_loop()`` function simply reads one line after another until the "

msgid ""
"The ``SimpleCompleter`` class keeps a list of \"options\" that are "
"candidates for auto-completion.  The ``complete()`` method for an instance "
"is designed to be registered with :mod:`readline` as the source of "
"completions.  The arguments are a \"text\" string to complete and a "
"\"state\" value, indicating how many times the function has been called with"
" the same text.  The function is called repeatedly with the state "
"incremented each time.  It should return a string if there is a candidate "
"for that state value or ``None`` if there are no more candidates.  The "
"implementation of ``complete()`` here looks for a set of matches when state "
"is ``0``, and then returns all of the candidate matches one at a time on "
"subsequent calls."
