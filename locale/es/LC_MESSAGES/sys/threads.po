msgid ""
"Python 2 uses a form of cooperative multitasking in its thread "
"implementation.  At a fixed interval, bytecode execution is paused and the "
"interpreter checks if any signal handlers need to be executed. During the "
"same interval check, the global interpreter lock is also released by the "
"current thread and then reacquired, giving other threads an opportunity to "
"take over execution by grabbing the lock first."
msgstr ""

#: ../../PyMOTW/sys/threads.rst:21
msgid ""
"The default check interval is 100 bytecodes and the current value can always"
" be retrieved with :func:`sys.getcheckinterval`.  Changing the interval with"
" :func:`sys.setcheckinterval` may have an impact on the performance of an "
"application, depending on the nature of the operations being performed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../PyMOTW/sys/threads.rst:31
msgid ""
"When the check interval is smaller than the number of bytecodes in a thread,"
" the interpreter may give another thread control so that it runs for a "
"while.  This is illustrated in the first set of output where the check "
"interval is set to 100 (the default) and 1000 extra loop iterations are "
"performed for each step through the ``i`` loop."

msgid ""
"On the other hand, when the check interval is *greater* than the number of "
"bytecodes being executed by a thread that doesn't release control for "
"another reason, the thread will finish its work before the interval comes "
"up.  This is illustrated by the order of the name values in the queue in the"
" second example."

"Modifying the check interval is not as clearly useful as it might seem.  "
"Many other factors may control the context switching behavior of Python's "
"threads.  For example, if a thread performs I/O, it releases the GIL and may"
" therefore allow another thread to take over execution."

"This example is modified from the first so that the thread prints directly "
"to :const:`sys.stdout` instead of appending to a queue.  The output is much "
