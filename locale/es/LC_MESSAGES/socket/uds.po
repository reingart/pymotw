"From the programmer's perspective there are two essential differences "
"between using a Unix domain socket and an TCP/IP socket.  First, the address"
" of the socket is a path on the filesystem, rather than a tuple containing "
"servername and port.  Second, the node created in the filesystem to "
"represent the socket persists after the socket is closed, and needs to be "
"removed each time the server starts up.  The echo server example from "
"earlier can be updated to use UDS by making a few changes in the setup "
"section."

"The client setup also needs to be modified to work with UDS.  It should "
"assume the filesystem node for the socket exists, since the server creates "
"it by binding to the address."

"The :func:`socketpair` function is useful for setting up UDS sockets for "
"interprocess communication under Unix.  It creates a pair of connected "
"sockets that can be used to communicate between a parent process and a child"
" process after the child is forked."
