"The :mod:`dis` module includes functions for working with Python bytecode by"
" \"disassembling\" it into a more human-readable form. Reviewing the "
"bytecodes being executed by the interpreter is a good way to hand-tune tight"
" loops and perform other kinds of optimizations. It is also useful for "
"finding race conditions in multi-threaded applications, since you can "
"estimate the point in your code where thread control may switch."

"In this case, the source translates to 5 different operations to create and "

"STORE_MAP to pop off the new key and value to be added to the dictionary.  "

"Sometimes when debugging an exception it can be useful to see which bytecode"
" caused a problem.  There are a couple of ways to disassemble the code "
"around an error."
msgstr ""

#: ../../PyMOTW/dis/index.rst:175
msgid ""
"The first is by using ``dis.dis()`` in the interactive interpreter to report"
" about the last exception.  If no argument is passed to ``dis``, then it "
"looks for an exception and shows the disassembly of the top of the stack "
"that caused it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../PyMOTW/dis/index.rst:201
msgid ""
"Notice the ``-->`` indicating the opcode that caused the error.  There is no"
" ``i`` variable defined, so the value associated with the name can't be "
"loaded onto the stack."
msgstr ""

#: ../../PyMOTW/dis/index.rst:205
msgid ""
"Within your code you can also print the information about an active "
"traceback by passing it to ``dis.distb()`` directly.  In this example, there"
" is a DivideByZero exception, but since the formula has two divisions it "
"isn't clear which part is zero."
msgstr ""

#: ../../PyMOTW/dis/index.rst:213
msgid ""
"The bad value is easy to spot when it is loaded onto the stack in the "
"disassembled version.  The bad operation is highlighted with the ``-->``, "
"and we just need to look up a few lines higher to find where ``i``'s ``0`` "
"value was pushed onto the stack."

msgid ""
"Aside from debugging errors, :mod:`dis` can also help you identify "
"performance issues in your code. Examining the disassembled code is "
"especially useful with tight loops where the number of exposed Python "
"instructions is low but they translate to an inefficient set of bytecodes.  "
"We can see how the disassembly is helpful by examining a few different "
"implementations of a class, ``Dictionary``, that reads a list of words and "
"groups them by their first letter."

"The output shows this version taking 0.1074 seconds to load the 234936 words"
" in my copy of ``/usr/share/dict/words`` on OS X.  That's not too bad, but "
"as you can see from the disassembly below, the loop is doing more work than "
"it needs to.  As it enters the loop in opcode 13, it sets up an exception "
"context (``SETUP_EXCEPT``).  Then it takes 6 opcodes to find "
"``self.by_letter[word[0]]`` before appending ``word`` to the list.  If there"
" is an exception because ``word[0]`` isn't in the dictionary yet, the "
"exception handler does all of the same work to determine ``word[0]`` (3 "
"opcodes) and sets ``self.by_letter[word[0]]`` to a new list containing the "
"word."
msgstr ""

#: ../../PyMOTW/dis/index.rst:375
msgid ""
"One technique to eliminate the exception setup is to pre-populate "
"``self.by_letter`` with one list for each letter of the alphabet. That means"
" we should always find the list we want for the new word, and can just do "
"the lookup and save the value."

"The change cuts the number of opcodes in half, but only shaves the time down"
" to 0.0984 seconds.  Obviously the exception handling had some overhead, but"
" not a huge amount."
msgstr ""

#: ../../PyMOTW/dis/index.rst:416
msgid ""
"We can further improve the performance by moving the lookup for "
"``self.by_letter`` outside of the loop (the value doesn't change, after "
"all)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../PyMOTW/dis/index.rst:423
msgid ""
"Opcodes 0-6 now find the value of ``self.by_letter`` and save it as a local "
"variable ``by_letter``.  Using a local variable only takes a single opcode, "
"instead of 2 (statement 22 uses ``LOAD_FAST`` to place the dictionary onto "
"the stack).  After this change, the run time is down to 0.0842 seconds."

"A further optimization, suggested by Brandon Rhodes, is to eliminate the "
"Python version of the ``for`` loop entirely. If we use "
":ref:`itertools.groupby() <itertools-groupby>` to arrange the input, the "
"iteration is moved to C.  We can do this safely because we know the inputs "
"are already sorted.  If you didn't know they were sorted you would need to "
"sort them first."
