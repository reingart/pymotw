":mod:`doctest` lets you test your code by running examples embedded in the "
"documentation and verifying that they produce the expected results.  It "
"works by parsing the help text to find examples, running them, then "
"comparing the output text against the expected value.  Many developers find "
":mod:`doctest` easier than :mod:`unittest` because in its simplest form, "
"there is no API to learn before using it.  However, as the examples become "
"more complex the lack of fixture management can make writing :mod:`doctest` "
"tests more cumbersome than using :mod:`unittest`."

"To run the tests, use :mod:`doctest` as the main program via the ``-m`` "

"Examples cannot usually stand on their own as explanations of a function, so"

"There are other cases where the exact output may not be predictable, but "
"should still be testable.  Local date and time values and object ids change "
"on every test run.  The default precision used in the representation of "
"floating point values depend on compiler options. Object string "
"representations may not be deterministic.  Although these conditions are "
"outside of your control, there are techniques for dealing with them."

"When the tests include values that are likely to change in unpredictable "

msgstr ""

#: ../../PyMOTW/doctest/index.rst:172
msgid ""
"The comment after the call to :func:`unpredictable` (``#doctest: "

"that test.  The ``...`` replaces the memory address in the object id, so "
"that portion of the expected value is ignored and the actual output matches "
"and the test passes."

"There are cases where you cannot ignore the unpredictable value, because "
"that would obviate the test.  For example, simple tests quickly become more "

"based on the order the keys are added."

msgstr ""

#: ../../PyMOTW/doctest/index.rst:235
msgid ""
"The best way to deal with these potential discrepancies is to create tests "
"that produce values that are not likely to change.  In the case of "
