"A common problem when working with input text is to identify a sequence of "
"quoted words as a single entity. Splitting the text on quotes does not "
"always work as expected, especially if there are nested levels of quotes. "
"Take the following text:"

"A naive approach might attempt to construct a regular expression to find the"
" parts of the text outside the quotes to separate them from the text inside "
"the quotes, or vice versa. Such an approach would be unnecessarily complex "
"and prone to errors resulting from edge cases like apostrophes or even "
"typos. A better solution is to use a true parser, such as the one provided "
"by the :mod:`shlex` module. Here is a simple example that prints the tokens "
"identified in the input file:"

"Since the parser is intended to be used with command languages, it needs to "

" comment prefixes are supported. The set of comment characters used can be "

"The :class:`shlex` class includes several configuration properties which "
"allow us to control its behavior. The *source* property enables a feature "
"for code (or configuration) re-use by allowing one token stream to include "
"another. This is similar to the Bourne shell ``source`` operator, hence the "
"name."

"Notice the string ``source quotes.txt`` embedded in the original text. Since"
" the source property of the lexer is set to \"source\", when the keyword is "
"encountered the filename appearing in the next title is automatically "
"included. In order to cause the filename to appear as a single token, the "
"``.`` character needs to be added to the list of characters that are "
"included in words (otherwise \"``quotes.txt``\" becomes three tokens, "
"\"``quotes``\", \"``.``\", \"``txt``\"). The output looks like:"

"I have already given an example changing the *wordchars* value to control "
"which characters are included in words. It is also possible to set the "
"*quotes* character to use additional or alternative quotes. Each quote must "

msgstr ""

#: ../../PyMOTW/shlex/index.rst:297
msgid ""
"When the parser encounters the end of its input before all quoted strings "
"are closed, it raises :ref:`ValueError <exceptions-ValueError>`. When that "
"happens, it is useful to examine some of the properties of the parser "
"maintained as it processes the input. For example, *infile* refers to the "
"name of the file being processed (which might be different from the original"
" file, if one file sources another). The *lineno* reports the line when the "
"error is discovered. The *lineno* is typically the end of the file, which "
"may be far away from the first quote. The *token* attribute contains the "
"buffer of text not already included in a valid token. The "
":func:`error_leader()` method produces a message prefix in a style similar "
"to Unix compilers, which enables editors such as emacs to parse the error "
"and take the user directly to the invalid line."
