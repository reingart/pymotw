"The :mod:`inspect` module provides functions for learning about live "

"function, look at the arguments to a method on the stack, and extract the "
"sort of information useful for producing library documentation for your "
"source code.  My own `CommandLineApp`_ module uses inspect to determine the "
"valid options to a command line program, as well as any arguments and their "
"names so command line programs are self-documenting and the help text is "

" frame object, the filename where the code exists, the line number in that "
"file for the current line being run, the function name being called, a list "
"of lines of context from the source file, and the index into that list of "
