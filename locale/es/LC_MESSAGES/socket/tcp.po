"Sockets can be configured to act as a *server* and listen for incoming "
"messages, or connect to other applications as a *client*.  After both ends "

"This sample program, based on the one in the standard library documentation,"
" receives incoming messages and echos them back to the sender.  It starts by"

"Then :func:`bind` is used to associate the socket with the server address.  "
"In this case, the address is ``localhost``, referring to the current server,"
" and the port number is 10000."

"Calling :func:`listen` puts the socket into server mode, and :func:`accept` "
"waits for an incoming connection."

":func:`accept` returns an open connection between the server and client, "
"along with the address of the client.  The connection is actually a "
"different socket on another port (assigned by the kernel). Data is read from"
" the connection with :func:`recv` and transmitted with :func:`sendall`."

"When communication with a client is finished, the connection needs to be "

"The client program sets up its :class:`socket` differently from the way a "

"TCP/IP clients can save a few steps by using the convenience function "

":func:`create_connection` uses :func:`getaddrinfo` to find candidate "
"connection parameters, and returns a :class:`socket` opened with the first "
"configuration that creates a successful connection.  The :attr:`family`, "
":attr:`type`, and :attr:`proto` attributes can be examined to determine the "

"It is important to bind a server to the correct address, so that clients can"
" communicate with it.  The previous examples all used ``'localhost'`` as the"
" IP address, which limits connections to clients running on the same server."
"  Use a public address of the server, such as the value returned by "
":func:`gethostname`, to allow other hosts to connect.  This example modifies"
" the echo server to listen on an address specified via a command line "

"Many servers have more than one network interface, and therefore more than "
"one IP address.  Rather than running separate copies of a service bound to "
"each IP address, use the special address :const:`INADDR_ANY` to listen on "
"all addresses at the same time.  Although :mod:`socket` defines a constant "
"for :const:`INADDR_ANY`, it is an integer value and must be converted to a "
"dotted-notation string address before it can be passed to :func:`bind`.  As "
