"The function getstatusoutput() runs a command via the shell and returns the "
"exit code and the text output (stdout and stderr combined). The exit codes "
"are the same as for the C function wait() or os.wait(). The code is a 16-bit"
" number. The low byte contains the signal number that killed the process. "
"When the signal is zero, the high byte is the exit status of the program. If"
" a core file was produced, the high bit of the low byte is set."

"This example runs two commands that exit normally, a third meant to generate"
" a core dump, and a fourth that blocks waiting to be killed from another "
"shell. (Don't simply use Ctrl-C as the interpreter will intercept that "
"signal. Use ps and grep in another window to find the read process and send "
"it a signal with kill.)"

"In this example, I used ``kill -HUP $PID`` to kill the reading process from "
