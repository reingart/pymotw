":rfc:`4122` defines a system for creating universally unique identifiers for"
" resources in a way that does not require a central registrar. UUID values "
"are 128 bits long and \"can guarantee uniqueness across space and time\". "
"They are useful for identifiers for documents, hosts, application clients, "
"and other situations where a unique value is necessary. The RFC is "
"specifically geared toward creating a Uniform Resource Name namespace."

"are several well-known namespaces, identified by pre-defined UUID values, "
