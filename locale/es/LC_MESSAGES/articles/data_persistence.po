"Python provides several modules for storing data.  There are basically two "
"aspects to persistence: converting the in-memory object back and forth into "
"a format for saving it, and working with the storage of the converted data."

msgid ""
"Python includes two modules capable of converting objects into a "
"transmittable or storable format (*serializing*): :mod:`pickle` and "
":mod:`json`.  It is most common to use :mod:`pickle`, since there is a fast "
"C implementation and it is integrated with some of the other standard "
"library modules that actually store the serialized data, such as "
":mod:`shelve`.  Web-based applications may want to examine :mod:`json`, "
"however, since it integrates better with some of the existing web service "
"storage applications."

"Once the in-memory object is converted to a storable format, the next step "
"is to decide how to store the data.  A simple flat-file with serialized "
"objects written one after the other works for data that does not need to be "
"indexed in any way.  But Python includes a collection of modules for storing"
" key-value pairs in a simple database using one of the DBM format variants."
msgstr ""

#: ../../PyMOTW/articles/data_persistence.rst:21
msgid ""
"The simplest interface to take advantage of the DBM format is provided by "
":mod:`shelve`.  Simply open the shelve file, and access it through a "
"dictionary-like API.  Objects saved to the shelve are automatically pickled "
"and saved without any extra work on your part."
msgstr ""

#: ../../PyMOTW/articles/data_persistence.rst:23
msgid ""
"One drawback of shelve is that with the default interface you can't "
"guarantee which DBM format will be used.  That won't matter if your "
"application doesn't need to share the database files between hosts with "
"different libraries, but if that is needed you can use one of the classes in"
" the module to ensure a specific format is selected (:ref:`shelve-shelf-"
"types`)."

msgid ""
"If you're going to be passing a lot of data around via JSON anyway, using "
":mod:`json` and :mod:`anydbm` can provide another persistence mechanism.  "
"Since the DBM database keys and values must be strings, however, the objects"
" won't be automatically re-created when you access the value in the "
"database."

"The excellent :mod:`sqlite3` in-process relational database is available "
"with most Python distributions.  It stores its database in memory or in a "
"local file, and all access is from within the same process, so there is no "
"network lag.  The compact nature of :mod:`sqlite3` makes it especially well "
"suited for embedding in desktop applications or development versions of web "
"apps."
msgstr ""

#: ../../PyMOTW/articles/data_persistence.rst:33
msgid ""
"All access to the database is through the Python DBI 2.0 API, by default, as"
" no object relational mapper (ORM) is included.  The most popular general "
"purpose ORM is `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_, but others such "
"as Django's native ORM layer also support SQLite.  SQLAlchemy is easy to "
"install and set up, but if your objects aren't very complicated and you are "
"worried about overhead, you may want to use the DBI interface directly."

"Although not usually considered a true persistence format :mod:`csv`, or "
"comma-separated-value, files can be an effective way to migrate data between"
" applications.  Most spreadsheet programs and databases support both export "
"and import using CSV, so dumping data to a CSV file is frequently the "
"simplest way to move data out of your application and into an analysis tool."
