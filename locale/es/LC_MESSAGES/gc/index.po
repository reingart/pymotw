":mod:`gc` exposes the underlying memory management mechanism of Python, the "
"automatic garbage collector.  The module includes functions for controlling "
"how the collector operates and to examine the objects known to the system, "
"either pending collection or stuck in reference cycles and unable to be "
"freed."

"With :mod:`gc` you can use the incoming and outgoing references between "
"objects to find cycles in complex data structures.  If you know the data "
"structure with the cycle, you can construct custom code to examine its "
"properties.  If not, you can the :func:`get_referents()` and "
":func:`get_referrers()` functions to build generic debugging tools."

"This example uses a :mod:`Queue` to perform a breadth-first traversal of all"

"The cycle in the nodes is easily found by watching for objects that have "
"already been processed.  To avoid holding references to those objects, their"
" :func:`id()` values are cached in a set.  The dictionary objects found in "
"the cycle are the ``__dict__`` values for the :class:`Graph` instances, and "

"Although the garbage collector runs automatically as the interpreter "

":func:`collect()`."
msgstr ""

"In this example, the cycle is cleared as soon as collection runs the first "
"time, since nothing refers to the :class:`Graph` nodes except themselves.  "
":func:`collect()` returns the number of \"unreachable\" objects it found.  "

"instance attribute dictionaries."

"Looking for the object holding a reference to something in the garbage is a "
"little trickier than seeing what an object references.  Because the code "
"asking about the reference needs to hold a reference itself, some of the "
"referrers need to be ignored.  This example creates a graph cycle, then "
"works through the :class:`Graph` instances in the garbage and removes the "
"reference in the \"parent\" node."

"The garbage collector maintains three lists of objects it sees as it runs, "

"The collector routines can be tuned to occur at different frequencies based "
"on the difference between the number of object allocations and deallocations"

"collector is run.  The current thresholds can be examined with "
":func:`get_threshold()`."
