"*Regular expressions* are text matching patterns described with a formal "
"syntax.  The patterns are interpreted as a set of instructions, which are "
"then executed with a string as input to produce a matching subset or "
"modified version of the original.  The term \"regular expressions\" is "
"frequently shortened to as \"regex\" or \"regexp\" in conversation.  "
"Expressions can include literal text matching, repetition, pattern-"
"composition, branching, and other sophisticated rules.  A large number of "
"parsing problems are easier to solve with a regular expression than by "
"creating a special-purpose lexer and parser."

" sed, grep, and awk.  Many programming languages include support for regular"
