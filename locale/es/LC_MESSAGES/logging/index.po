"The :mod:`logging` module defines a standard API for reporting errors and "
"status information from applications and libraries. The key benefit of "
"having the logging API provided by a standard library module is that all "
"Python modules can participate in logging, so an application's log can "
"include messages from third-party modules."

"There are two perspectives for examining logging.  Application developers "
"set up the :mod:`logging` module, directing the messages to appropriate "
"output channels.  It is possible to log messages with different verbosity "
"levels or to different destinations. Handlers for writing log messages to "
"files, HTTP GET/POST locations, email via SMTP, generic sockets, or OS-"
"specific logging mechanisms are all included, and it is possible to create "
"custom log destination classes for special requirements not handled by any "
"of the built-in classes."

"separate logger object for each module. Every new logger inherits the "
"configuration of its parent, and log messages sent to a logger include the "
"name of that logger. Optionally, each logger can be configured differently, "
